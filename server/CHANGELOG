Version 1.2.2, March 23, 2005
------------------------------

Changes	    - fixed a bug that would cause the server to exit if a
	    connected client terminated in a certain situation
	    - tidied up some pathing issues with where it tried to find
	    the mac address file
	    - changed some logic to better work with the libtrace framework,
	    also helps avoid crashes when trying to view fragmented packets


Version 1.2.1, March 22, 2005
------------------------------

Changes	    - server now sends version information when clients connect
	    to help prevent client/server mismatch.



------------------------------
Version 1.2.0, March 18, 2005

Changes	    - Integrated 'darknet' support. Internal addresses are divided 
	    into two classes...those that have sourced traffic, and those that
	    have not. Packets are marked, which allows the client to 
	    distinguish and filter those packets that are travelling to used
	    addresses or unused addresses. This is updated in real time as
	    packets are received, and saved to file to be persistant across
	    runs.
	    - the multiplenet24 position module now uses real numbers rather
	    than integers to prevent a squashing of the coordinate space with
	    large numbers of networks.
	    - macaddrfile is now relative to basedir option



------------------------------
Version 1.1.0, February 4, 2005

First public release.
Changes	    - rtt estimation
	    - client side cycling of traffic types
	    - useful configuration file
	    - modular system for colour, direction, position
