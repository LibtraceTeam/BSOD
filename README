BSOD: Network Traffic Visualisation

Copyright (c) 2004-2015 The University of Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand.

The bsod visualisation tool uses the libtrace framework to transform network
traffic into a graphical format that can be viewed in real time. Capturing from
a live network interface, or from a saved trace file, bsod visualises the flow
of network data between hosts, providing (at a glance) information about
network usage.

BSOD consists of two components: a server that processes captured packets and
a client that renders the visualisation.

More details about each component, including installation and configuration
instructions, can be found in their individual READMEs or on the BSOD web-page 
(http://research.wand.net.nz/software/visualisation.php).
