- We can get smoother perfomance under ihug-style loads with the vertex shader 
particle system by limiting to Nk particles per frame
- Resizing the window goes badly on Windows (and is disabled currently)
- Move to glDrawArrays throughout (need to change memory layout...)
- Auto benchmark to figure out the 'best' particle system backend
- Change ps backends in real time
- Better picking for the start/end points - 'best' hit rather than first
