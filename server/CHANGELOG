Version 1.2.0, March 18, 2005

Changes	    - Integrated 'darknet' support. Internal addresses are divided 
	    into two classes...those that have sourced traffic, and those that
	    have not. Packets are marked, which allows the client to 
	    distinguish and filter those packets that are travelling to used
	    addresses or unused addresses. This is updated in real time as
	    packets are received, and saved to file to be persistant across
	    runs.
	    - the multiplenet24 position module now uses real numbers rather
	    than integers to prevent a squashing of the coordinate space with
	    large numbers of networks.
