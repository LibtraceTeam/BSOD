Building BSOD client under Linux / OSX
=======================================

First step, make sure you have installed all of the libraries that BSOD
client depends upon. These are:
	* libSDL
	* libSDL_net
	* libSDL_ttf
	* libIL		
	* libILU
	* libILUT
	* libGLEW
	* libconfuse
	* libCEGUI

Debian/Ubuntu users can get all of these libraries using the following command:

	sudo apt-get install libsdl-dev libsdl-net1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev libdevil-dev libglew-dev libconfuse-dev libcegui-mk2-dev


Then, run the following commands:
	./configure
	make

If you are missing any of the above libraries, the configure step will fail and
should tell you which ones you are missing.

The bsodclient binary will be created in the 'runtime' directory. Run the
client from within that directory.


Building BSOD client under Windows
==================================

If you are just wanting to run BSOD client, a precompiled Windows binary
should be included with your download. Simply run that binary to start a BSOD
client.

A Visual Studio 2008 solution is also included in the 'windows' directory. It
may need adjusting to set paths for your particular machine setup.
