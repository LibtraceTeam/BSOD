Installing bsod-server:

----------------------------------
The bsod server requires:

* libtrace (http://www.wand.net.nz/ ...)
* g++-3.0 or greater (known to work with 3.0, fails with 2.95)



----------------------------------
To make and install the bsod server:

Ensure that libtrace is properly installed (refer to the
documentation that comes with it for information on how to do this).


Linux:

tar xzvf bsod-server-x.y.z.tar.gz
cd bsod-x.y.z
cd server
make
(as root)
make install 


FreeBSD:

Exactly the same as the above, replacing 'make' with 'gmake'.
You will probably need to remove the reference to -ldl from the Makefile
in order to compile. We should have an automake system ready for the
next release which will solve this problem.



----------------------------------
Running the bsod server:

It is very likely that you will need to edit the default configuration
file in order to get a meaningful visualisation. See the appropriate 
section in the README for more information on the format of the file 
and the options that can be configured.

Usage: /usr/local/bsod/bin/bsod_server [-h] [-b] -C <configfile>
    -h			this help screen
    -b			background (daemonise) the bsod server
    -C <configfile>	specify an alternate configuration file instead of
			the default /usr/local/bsod/etc/bsod_server.conf
