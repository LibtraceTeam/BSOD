\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}


Network visualisation well established as a means for interpreting large amounts of data.

BSOD presents near real time visualisation of actual traffic.

Enables immediate understanding of network use, some performance aspects, detection of attacks and security violations.

\subsection{Background}

Current visualisations mostly limited to measured statistics.  Some topology maps, graphs of measurements (MRTG) and some combination into wheather maps (Internet2, Perry's friend).

Traffic viewing normally offline (Ethereal, tcpdump)

Attempts at data animation limited:

Cichlid~\cite{web:cichlid} a generic data viz toolkit

The Spinning Cube of Potential Doom.  linked to Bro IDS

\subsection{Development History}

Attempts at real time traffic animation in Cichlid: worked, but too slow.

Moved to 3D game engine for speed.  Use of modern 3D GPU hardware.

Continuous incremental improvement to increase flexibility and performance.

Now release GPL
