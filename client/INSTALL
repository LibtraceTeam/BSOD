Building BSOD client under Linux 
=======================================

First step, make sure you have installed all of the libraries that BSOD
client depends upon. These are:
	* libSDL
	* libSDL_net
	* libSDL_ttf
	* libpng
	* libGLEW
	* libconfuse
	* libCEGUI

Debian/Ubuntu users can get all of these libraries using the following command:

	sudo apt-get install libsdl-dev libsdl-net1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev libglew-dev libconfuse-dev libcegui-mk2-dev libpng12-dev


Then, run the following commands:
	./configure
	make

If you are missing any of the above libraries, the configure step will fail and
should tell you which ones you are missing.

The bsodclient binary will be created in the 'runtime' directory. Run the
client from within that directory.


Building BSOD client under Mac OS X
===================================

If you wish to build the BSOD client from source, you will first need to ensure
that you have installed all the required dependencies.

NOTE: We also distribute a pre-built universal app bundle for Mac OS X, which 
you may wish to try using instead of building from source.

The easiest way to do this is to use macports (http://www.macports.org).
Install the following ports:
	* libsdl
	* libsdl_net
	* libsdl_ttf
	* libpng
	* glew
	* libconfuse

You will also need the CEGUI 0.7 framework, which can be downloaded from
http://www.cegui.org.uk/wiki/index.php/Downloads - you want the binary download
for Apple Mac OS X. Place both CEGUIBase.framework and 
CEGUIOpenGLRenderer.framework into /Library/Frameworks. Also download the
dependencies package and install the frameworks contained within into
/Library/Frameworks as well.

Now you should be able to run:
	./configure
	make

The configure step should tell you if any libraries are missing. The bsodclient
binary will be created in the 'runtime' directory. Run the client from within
that directory.

Building BSOD client under Windows
==================================

Building BSOD client from source under Windows is not supported. Please use
the pre-compiled Windows binary if you want to run bsodclient.
