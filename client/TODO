======================
 From NZNOG feedback
======================

- Disable CEGUI log and catch the CEGUI exception. 
- Make server window more HCI-friendly
- Internet master server style lookups for public servers
- Server layout module needs to be able to push a random string to the client
  that is displayed in the endpoint info pane. 

=========================
 Faster particle systems
=========================

- We can get smoother perfomance under ihug-style loads with the vertex shader 
  particle system by limiting to Nk particles per frame
- We can get even *better* performance by rendering each Nk particles to a 
  seperate texture, and only updating those textures every Nk/total seconds.
- Possibly there's a good system where we render a different particle type every
  frame and don't clear the frame buffer. That's very very fast...but you can't
  *un-render* them, so they'll leave trails.


========================
  Other random stuff
========================

- Auto rotate options
- More keyboard options
- Keyboard driven GUI
- Resizing the window goes badly on Windows (and is disabled currently).
	- In fact it's a bit clunky everywhere tbh. 
- Move to glDrawArrays throughout (need to change memory layout of particles)
- Auto benchmark to figure out the 'best' particle system backend
- Change ps backends in real time
- Better picking for the start/end points - 'best' hit rather than first
- Classic PS needs to do some form of billboarding to make the particles face 
  the camera. We can probably apply the same transformation to all of them and 
  not care about the slight distortion on the edges.
- OSX support
- Move Windows build to VS2008
