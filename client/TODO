* Look into quick and cheap billboarding. Was a little harder than my first
  go...

Done:

* Persistant particles at start (end?) of flows. DONE
* More efficiency improvements. DONE
* Fix networking dodginess: when the server dies, the client gets stuffed.
* Client says it is connected when it isn't. 
* Use better networking (library) perhaps. HawkNL allows it to be cross
  platform, but seems kinda nasty and I don't think it is updated anymore.
  Some basic BSD sockets code would do, it would allow for better error
  checking I believe.
