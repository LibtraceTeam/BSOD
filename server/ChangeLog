Version 2.0.3, May 15, 2013
---------------------------
Changes
	* Fixed assertion failure caused by the timer list developing a 
	  broken ordering
	* Fixed invalid free crash when using the lpicolour module
	* Fixed bug where a plugin could be initialised with a NULL parameter
	* Ensure that we only remove and re-insert a client callback function
	  if the read-write properties of the callback have changed
	* Added new config option -- client_wait. Setting this to true will
	  prevent the server from processing any packets until the first
	  client has connected
	* Fixed small memory leaks when looping over trace files
	* Nicer error reporting when the user fails to provide a traffic source
	  in the config file

Version 2.0.2, Feb 17, 2012
---------------------------
Changes     - Fixed build problem caused by a failure to correctly link 
	      against libdl.
	    - Fixed bug that would cause connected clients to crash or not 
	      display any packets when using recent versions of libprotoident. 

Version 2.0.1, Mar 15, 2011
---------------------------
Changes	    - Added new colour module that uses libprotoident to identify
	      applications.
	    - Moved to libwandevent for managing main loop, which should
	      provide more timely response to events, i.e. incoming connections.
	    - Switch to autotool-based build system.
	    - Fixed annoying error messages that pop up when the blacklist is
	      loaded for the first time.

Version 2.0.0, Jan 26, 2009
----------------------------

Changes	    - Added UDP multicast support for automatic server location
	    - Added support for pushing images to the client
	    - Moved to libconfuse for config files instead of libconfig. Note 
	      that the syntax is slightly different - 'key = value' instead of 
	      'key value' in the config files. 



Version 1.2.2, March 23, 2005
------------------------------

Changes	    - fixed a bug that would cause the server to exit if a
	    connected client terminated in a certain situation
	    - tidied up some pathing issues with where it tried to find
	    the mac address file
	    - changed some logic to better work with the libtrace framework,
	    also helps avoid crashes when trying to view fragmented packets


Version 1.2.1, March 22, 2005
------------------------------

Changes	    - server now sends version information when clients connect
	    to help prevent client/server mismatch.



------------------------------
Version 1.2.0, March 18, 2005

Changes	    - Integrated 'darknet' support. Internal addresses are divided 
	    into two classes...those that have sourced traffic, and those that
	    have not. Packets are marked, which allows the client to 
	    distinguish and filter those packets that are travelling to used
	    addresses or unused addresses. This is updated in real time as
	    packets are received, and saved to file to be persistant across
	    runs.
	    - the multiplenet24 position module now uses real numbers rather
	    than integers to prevent a squashing of the coordinate space with
	    large numbers of networks.
	    - macaddrfile is now relative to basedir option



------------------------------
Version 1.1.0, February 4, 2005

First public release.
Changes	    - rtt estimation
	    - client side cycling of traffic types
	    - useful configuration file
	    - modular system for colour, direction, position
