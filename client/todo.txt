The BuNg TODO file.

- Stuff:
* Fix bounding box of level -- x,y,z ordered incorrectly? -- DONE. -- one level still is a bit stuffed up
* Fix beziers: some of them seem to miss a bit?  Only shows up in dm1
* Look into shaders for more texture info
* Get lightmaps out
* MD3 files - Somewhat done - Jesse
* A lot of code isn't exception safe yet.  Use auto_ptr<> to solve this. (somewhat done)
  -- also, a lot doesn't seem to be cleaned up upon exit -- Fixed mostly
* Find use for pig -- Powerup?  It's gonna need a name.
* Put external components into .DLL's and .so's (linux).  This means we have completely
  replacable components, a "good thing" in OO programming.  If we load these at run-time,
  or after startup anyway, we can only load those that are necessary thereby conserving
  memory.

- More important stuff
* MD2's need drawing fixes
* For fixing collision detection:
  * If the new position is D away from the current position, do a ray-collision (this stops large
    velocities from going through walls.  Where D is the diameter of the collision sphere.
* GET RID OF DEGENERATE TRIANGLES IN BUNGMAP.  I AM SHOUTING SO THIS MUST BE IMPORTANT! 
	(used to be: * See colldet.cpp (bad normal)) -- Hmm, this may not matter at all anymore ????? doesn't matter ????
* Networking! -- Somewhat done (Sam) -- look into NLU??
* D3D renderer. -- Somewhat done (Sam) - This needs fixing
* Fix bouncing in collision response! - Jesse is onto this
* Allow shooting a rocket. Yes, a rocket. A slow rocket that dies when it hits something. - Sam
* (Very) simple gui? Allow buttons and text entry (add chat feature to networking). - Probably Sam



The camera should be able to transform local/object coordinates to world space coordinates.

Billboard entities.

Texture/resource management.

Factories for models.

Better lightmap management.

- Everything below here is finished
* Normals from .bsp files - bungmap's job -- DONE
* MD2 files - DONE
* Fix insertion of CMesh's into the octree -- bounding box calc. function -- DONE
* Load quake meshes in -- DONE
* Textures seem to have incorrect indices (some do anyway) -- DONE
* Clean up bezier code - half done - need to add dynamic level of detail (not just 11x11) -- DONE
* Collision detection and response!  This is the next big thing. -- DONE to a satisfactory level 16-6-02
* Fix up namespace issues and warning with Opcode (processing (Sam)) -- DONE 18-6-02
* Fix beziers: drawing and collision detection -- DONE 21-6-02
* 24 June 2002 -- 6402 Lines of Code in total for BuNg!
* Fix up Vectors once and for all(mostly done, probably needs testing).  Also check for consts. -- DONE 29-6-02
* Better font handling -- DONE
* Configuration file handler - Done - Sam! - 22-07-02
* Set up blending mode shit in an API neutral way (drawing the box for a text-backdrop needs a different
    blending mode)
* Linux system driver (SDL ?) - Done
