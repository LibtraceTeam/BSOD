This directory contains source code for BSOD client, a network traffic
visualisation tool which displays the flow of network data between hosts in
real time. BSOD client is only one half of the visualisation process; it 
connects to a BSOD server which tells the client what it should be rendering
on screen.

Further information about both the BSOD client and server can be found at
http://research.wand.net.nz/software/visualisation.php

BSOD client is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 3.
Please see the include file COPYING for details of this license.

Running BSOD Client
===================
The BSOD client runs from the runtime/ directory. Edit the configuation file
"bsod2.cfg" to suit your requirements (see Configuration below) and then
simply run the bsodclient executable. It will automatically attempt to 
connect to the server specified in your config file, if you have specified one.

Configuration
=============
The "bsod2.cfg" file in the runtime/ directory describes all the configuration
for the BSOD client. Each configuration option is documented within the 
bsod2.cfg file itself.

The config file can be used to set the BSOD server to connect to, the 
screen resolution and the method to use to render the packet particles.

Note: autodetection of the particle method is not always reliable. If the BSOD 
client is performing poorly, try manually setting the particle method to
pointsprites or triangles.


Acknowledgements
================

The original BSOD client was developed by Sam Jansen and Brendon Jones and was
based on the BuNg 3D engine written by Sam Jansen and Jesse Baker 
(http://www.wand.net.nz/~stj2/bung/).

The current BSOD client was developed by Paul Hunkin and uses OpenGL.
