This directory contains source code for BSOD client, a network traffic
visualisation tool which displays the flow of network data between hosts in
real time. BSOD client is only one half of the visualisation process; it 
connects to a BSOD server which tells the client what it should be rendering
on screen.

Further information about both the BSOD client and server can be found at
http://research.wand.net.nz/software/visualisation.php

BSOD client is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 3.
Please see the include file COPYING for details of this license.

Running BSOD Client
===================
The BSOD client runs from the runtime/ directory. Edit the configuation file
"bsod2.cfg" to suit your requirements (see Configuration below) and then
simply run the bsodclient executable. It will automatically attempt to 
connect to the server specified in your config file, if you have specified one.

Configuration
=============
The "bsod2.cfg" file in the runtime/ directory provides all the configuration
for the BSOD client. Each configuration option is documented within the 
bsod2.cfg file itself.

The config file can be used to set the BSOD server to connect to, the 
screen resolution and the method to use to render the packet particles.

You can specify a different file by giving bsodclient the command line option 
'-C /path/to/config/file". Configuration options are pairs of the form:

<key> = <value>

The options supported by bsodclient are described below:

option: Server
	The bsodserver to connect to upon launch. This may be a hostname or an
	IP address. If you do not specify a server, you can manually connect
	using the server browser within bsodclient itself.

option: Port
	The port on the bsodserver to connect to.

option: LeftTex
	Specifies a texture to use on the left plane instead of the texture
	sent by the server.

option: RightTex
	Specifies a texture to use on the right plane instead of the texture
	sent by the server.

option: ResX
	Defines the screen resolution along the X axis. If 0 or not defined,
	the current desktop resolution will be used.

option: ResY
	Defines the screen resolution along the X axis. If 0 or not defined,
	the current desktop resolution will be used.

option: Fullscreen
	If 1, will run bsodclient in full screen mode. If 0, will attempt to
	run in windowed mode. Defaults to 1.

option: ParticleMethod
	Selects the method to render the particles. Possible options are:
	
		0 - autodetect, will try to guess the best option for you.
		1 - triangles, will work on just about anything but is slow.
		2 - pointsprites
		3 - shaders
		4 - texture (experimental)

	Note: autodetection of the particle method is not always reliable. If 
	the BSOD client is performing poorly, try manually setting the particle 
	method to pointsprites or triangles.

option: ParticleSizeScale
	Specifies a multiplier to apply to the size of the particles.

option: ParticleSpeedScale
	Specifies a multiplier to apply to the speed of the particles.

option: MaxFrameRate
	Specifies an upper-bound on the frame rate. If 0, frame rate is
	unlimited.

option: DropPacketThresh
	Specifies the minimum frame rate before bsodclient starts dropping
	packets.

option: DropFlowThresh
	Specifies the minimum frame rate before bsodclient starts dropping
	entire flows.

option: ShowDarknet
	If 1, darknet traffic will be shown. If 0, darknet traffic will not be
	displayed. Can also be toggled at runtime via the Options window.

option: ShowNonDarknet
	If 1, non-darknet traffic will be shown. If 0, non-darknet traffic will 
	not be displayed. Can also be toggled at runtime via the Options window.

option: FlipTextures
	If the textures are loaded upside down, set this option to 1 to flip
	them up the right way.

The original BSOD client was developed by Sam Jansen and Brendon Jones and was
based on the BuNg 3D engine written by Sam Jansen and Jesse Baker 
(http://www.wand.net.nz/~stj2/bung/).

The current BSOD client was developed by Paul Hunkin and uses OpenGL.
